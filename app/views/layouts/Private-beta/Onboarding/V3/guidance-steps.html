                <p class="govuk-body">When you start registering your business or organisation on this service, part of the process requires you to use Defra account registration.  
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">For example, when you start your <a href="#initial-setup" class="govuk-link">initial sign-up for your first business or organisation</a> , your Defra account will guide you through the process of collecting details of your name, contact details and business or organisation details.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">To <a href="#" class="govuk-link">add extra businesses or organisations</a>, you must enter their details in your Defra account too.</a>
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">You can also use the 'Manage' link on 'Your Defra account' page to <a href="#extra-team" class="govuk-link">add team members to your account</a> and manage their permissions.    
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">At the end of the Defra account registration, you can return to Report receipt of waste service to pay the annual service charge and start reporting receipt of waste at your site/s.
