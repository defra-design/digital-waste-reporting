              At least one user must be the person who is legally responsible for reporting the receipt of waste, usually the person who is currently responsible for managing your paper waste transfer notes or consignment notes.

                  In large businesses made up of multiple companies or other bodies, each individual limited company or body that has control over a permitted waste operation that receives controlled waste must pay the fee individually.

          <p class="govuk-body">
            Our new waste tracking service uses an API &#40;Application Programming Interface&#41;. This is a set of rules that allow different software applications to talk to each other.   
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            For example, you might already use your Google ID to sign into other apps and services. Or you might use PayPal to pay a bill. It's a convenient feature which uses APIs to authenticate users without asking them to create a new profile for every application. 
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            Our API allows your waste reporting software to talk to our waste tracking software. 
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            If you work with multiple software providers, there's an option to request multiple API codes. 
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            Check with your software provider how to give them the API code, for example will they need it emailing or inputting directly into their app? 
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            If you don't want to use the API code, you can use our alternative, spreadsheet-based reporting method. We'll add more details about this soon.
